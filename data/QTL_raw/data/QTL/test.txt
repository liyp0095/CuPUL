Here O

our O

we O

that O

Next O

Moreover O
, O
we O

The O

an O

Low O

we O
chose O

the O

the O

INTRODUCTION O
: O
Cryptorchidism B-Trait
is O
a O
hereditary O
anomaly O
characterized O
by O
the O
incomplete O
descent O
of O
one O
or O
both O
testicles O
to O
the O
scrotum O
. O

One O
of O
the O
challenges O
of O
this O
anomaly O
is O
that O
the O
retained O
testicle O
maintains O
its O
endocrine O
function O
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
, O
cryptorchid O
animals O
produce O
hormone-tainted O
meat O
in O
comparison O
to O
castrated O
animals O
and O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
more O
aggressive O
. O

Cryptorchidism B-Trait
can O
lead O
to O
reduced O
animal O
welfare O
outcomes O
and O
cause O
economic O
losses O
. O

Identifying O
genetic O
markers O
for O
cryptorchidism B-Trait
is O
an O
essential O
step O
toward O
mitigating O
these O
negative O
outcomes O
and O
may O
facilitate O
genome O
manipulation O
to O
reduce O
the O
occurrence O
of O
cryptorchidism B-Trait
. O

Attempts O
to O
identify O
such O
markers O
have O
used O
genome-wide O
association O

Using O

identify O

in O
the O

and O
to O

Tenderness B-Trait

a O
key O
meat B-Trait
quality I-Trait
trait I-Trait
that O
determines O
the O
public O
acceptance O

lamb O

so O
genetic O
improvement O

tenderness B-Trait

However O
, O
unravelling O
the O

the O

the O

Therefore O

Since O

that O

genes O
could O
be O
potential O

sheep O
. O

The O
genes O

identified O
in O
this O

cause O

thus O
could O
be O

further O

the O

Chicken B-Trait

an O

Therefore O

OBJECT O

Chicken O

the O

which O
is O

the O

A O

Notably O

The O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
found O
that O
the O

CONCLUSION O

Our O

To O

this O

we O

the O

The O
results O
focused O
on O
the O
expression O

the O
MyoD1 O
gene O
in O
skeletal O

was O
much O

Furthermore O

The O

that O

Meanwhile O

the O
genetic O

Genome-wide O

that O
the O

the O

to O
be O
elucidated O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
performed O
a O
genome-wide O
association O
study O
on O
158 O
cattle O
to O
explain O
the O
genetic O
mechanism O

One O

between O
36.79 O

included O
50 O
suggestive O
SNPs O
and O
4 O
significant O
SNPs O
that O
were O
significantly O

with O
ear B-Trait

. O

The O
most O
significant O
locus O
( O
P O

1.30 O
× O
10-8 O
) O
was O
a O
missense O
mutation O
( O
T250I O

on O
the O
seventh O
exon O

23.46 O

Furthermore O
, O
this O
mutation O
will O
cause O
changes O
in O
the O
three-dimensional O
structure O
of O
the O
protein O
. O

To O
further O
identify O
genes O
underlying O
this O
typical O
feature O
, O
we O
performed O
a O
genome O
scan O
among O
nine O
cattle O
breeds O
with O
different O
ear B-Trait
sizes I-Trait
by O
using O
SweeD O

Results O
suggested O
that O
IBSP O
was O
under O
positive O
selection O
among O
four O
breeds O
with O
relatively O
large O
ear B-Trait
sizes I-Trait
. O

The O
expression O
levels O
of O
IBSP O
in O
ear O
tissues O
of O
large- O

small-ear O
cattle O
were O
significantly O
different O
. O

A O
haplotype O
diversity O
survey O
of O
this O
missense O

strongly O
implied O
that O
the O

These O

the O
exploration O

After O
